# Gold & Silver Price Analysis (2018–2023)
---

## Overview
This project analyzes 5 years of historical gold and silver price data (2018–2023), exploring trends and statistical relationships between the two commodities.

In addition to batch analysis, the project includes a **row-by-row simulation of streaming data** with artificial delays to mimic live updates. This allows experimentation with streaming concepts without the need for heavy infrastructure.

## Features

### Batch Analysis
- Cleaned and preprocessed historical gold and silver datasets.  
- Performed statistical correlation analysis using Pearson’s coefficient.  
- Visualized long-term price trends using matplotlib.

### Streaming Simulation
- Replayed historical data row by row with a delay to simulate live updates.  
- Computed incremental Pearson correlation on the fly.  
- Updated plots in real-time to demonstrate dynamic data flow.

## Key Learnings
- Difference between batch processing (full dataset at once) and row-wise streaming.  
- Demonstrated basic streaming concepts in Python without using heavy frameworks.  
- Built a minimal proof-of-concept pipeline for financial time-series analysis.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib  
- **Concepts:** Batch vs. streaming, correlation analysis, real-time data simulation

## Future Extensions
- Integrate a real streaming system using Kafka or similar frameworks.  
- Scale to multiple commodities and live market feeds.  
- Connect to cloud-based data pipelines for real-time analytics.
